Positive, Negative or Zero
NOTICE: 22nd April 2024 - Udemy is currently having problems with coding exercises. Valid solutions are sometimes
showing errors. This is a Udemy website problem, and I am working with Udemy to get this resolved. Apologies for the
inconvenience.

Write a method called checkNumber with an int parameter named number.

The method should not return any value, and it needs to print out:

    - "positive" if the parameter number is > 0

    - "negative" if the parameter number is < 0

    - "zero" if the parameter number is equal to 0

NOTE:  The checkNumber method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
